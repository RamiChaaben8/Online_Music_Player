//
// Lets surfaces that are not the sidebar ask the shell to open
// something in the centre view.
//
// The sidebar gets playlists as a direct callback
// (onPlaylistSelected). Anything deeper in the tree — the friend
// activity panel's playlist grid, or its "Open profile" menu entry —
// has no such handle, and pushing a route would land it on the
// mobile PlaylistScreen / FriendProfileScreen. Writing the request
// here instead lets the shell run it through its normal
// _navigateTo, so the view history and the back/forward buttons keep
// working.
//
// Set a value to open it; set null (or leave it alone) for nothing.
// The shell clears each after consuming.
